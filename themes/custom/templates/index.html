<p class="py-4">
  The aim of the IPsec and Networking Security e.V. is to <span class="font-semibold">build a strong open
    source/protocol community to make network security ready for the next generation</span>.
  The activities shall extend and support the work of standardization organizations with respect to real world
  implementation and use cases on open source operating systems.
</p>
<p class="py-4">
  Network security technologies became increasingly important over recent years. In the view of professional attacks
  against the core network infrastructure happening these days, network security technologies must be continously
  developed to make the network infrastructure futureproof.
</p>

<p class="py-4">
  IPsec as the major layer 3 network security protocol plays an important role in securing todays network. However, as
  networks continue to become more and more complex, network security technologies, like IPsec, must keep up with that
  increasing complexity.
